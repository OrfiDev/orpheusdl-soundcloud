## About OrpheusDL - SoundCloud

OrpheusDL - SoundCloud is a module written in Python which allows archiving from **SoundCloud** for the modular music archival program.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of Orpheus up and running:

### Prerequisites

You can customize every module from Orpheus individually and also set general/global settings which are active in every
loaded module. You'll find the configuration file here: `config/settings.json`
